			<h3>What is Aeon?</h3>

			<p>Aeon is the electronic system you use to request an item through Special Collections as well as track the history of requests you've received previously. </p>
		</div>

			<h3>Why do I need a username and password to use Aeon?</h3>

			<p>Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about
			your requests. We can also enable you to edit your personal information
			such as your address or phone number. </p>

			<p>Your username can be anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an
			alphanumeric code. Your password also can be anything you like. We recommend that you
			follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use
			to access other systems. However, no one but you will know your password, not even the
			special collections staff. The password you set is stored encrypted.</p>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>What if I forget my password?</h3>

			<p>In the event that you forget your password, please contact the Sepcial Collections office
			at (800) 555-1212. We can then reset your password allowing you access to Aeon. Please
			change your password once you logon to Aeon.</p>

	<a name="webbrowser"></a>
	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>What Web browser should I use?</h3>

			<p>You need a Web browser that can handle forms, tables, and preferrably cascading style sheets (CSS). We recommend the current versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.</p>

	<div class="faq-item">
		<div class="faq-item-box">
			<h3>Is security a problem if I use a public workstation?</a></h3>

			<p>Yes. Web browsers cache information and create a history file on the local workstation.
			This allows a subsequent user of the workstation to access the system under your name
			using the browser's Back button to recall a page from the cache, or by finding a page with
			your personal information in the browser's history file. If you are concerned about the
			security of your requests, you can take the following steps:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Access Aeon only from your personal computer or an otherwise secure workstation.</li>
    			<li>Access Aeon from a public workstation in the Special Collections office. These computers are supervised by the staff.</li>
    			<li>When using a public access workstation:
					<ol>
    					<li>Delete from the history file those pages that contain your personal information.</li>
    					<li>Exit from the Web browser before you leave the workstation. This prevents the Back button from accessing the pages you were using.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
