							<legend>First Time User Registration for Aeon</legend>

							<p>
							To request an item, you must first identify yourself to the library's Aeon system. To do this you fill out a registration form using your Web browser.<br />
							Registration has three purposes:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Entering your personal information into the Aeon system means you will not have to supply the information again when making future requests.</li>
								<li>Having your email and regular mail addresses on file with Special Collections enables us to notify you promptly and deliver materials accurately.</li>
								<li>By specifying a Username and Password of your choosing, you will have secure access to information about your requests. You will also be able to review
									the list of items you have requested in the past.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>About your Username and Password</h2>
							<p>
							During registration, you will be asked to choose a Username and Password. You will use this Username and Password when logging on to the Aeon system in the future.</p>

							<span class="bold">Username</span><br />
							Choose anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an alphanumeric code.<br />

							<span class="bold">Password</span><br />
							Choose anything you like. We recommend that you follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use to access other systems.<br />
							Aeon will encrypt your password, so it will remain secure. Only you will know your password.

							<hr />
