								<h2>Handling the materials</h2>

							<ul>
								<li>- Occasionally written permission is required to use Special Collections holdings, and some are closed for a period by the donor. Consult with staff concerning access to these collections.</li>
								<li>- Access may be denied when papers are awaiting processing or when their physical condition warrants. Consult with staff concerning these restrictions.</li>
								<li>- Materials must not be marked on, defaced, leaned on, altered, folded anew, or traced on. They are not to be placed in the lap or propped against edge of the table. Book supports may be used where appropriate. Use of gloves may be required to handle photographic and other fragile material. Photographs may not be removed from mylar coverings without permission.</li>
								<li>- The existing order and arrangement of material must be maintained. If an item seems to be out of order, please inform a staff member.</li>

								<li>- Permission must be granted for the use of tape recorders, digital cameras, and other special equipment.  Use of tripods, copy stands, flash, personal copiers, and scanners is not allowed.</li>
								<li>- All approved digital camera self-photography requests are for personal reference purposes only and cannot be reproduced; transferred to any other individual, institution, or collection; exhibited; performed; broadcast; published; posted on the internet; or used commercially.</li>
								<li>- Photoduplication is the responsibility of Princeton University staff.  Most forms of duplication can be made available, with appropriate fees applied, but may be limited with particular materials and collections for a variety of reasons, including but not restricted to physical condition, format, legal and donor-imposed restrictions, etc. </li>
								<li>- All photoduplication requests are contingent upon curatorial approval. The library reserves the right to refuse a request, or to limit the amount or format of duplication. Entire books or manuscript boxes (or substantial portions of either) will not be duplicated (unless otherwise authorized by curator). </li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Publication</h2>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Notice Warning Concerning Copyright Restrictions</b></li><br />
								<li>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research.”  If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of “fair use,” that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.</li><br />

								<li><b>Rights and Permissions</b></li><br />

								<li>Researchers must make a written request for permission to quote or publish manuscripts in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, or for one-time permission to reproduce images of any items found in the Department. In most cases, Princeton University owns only the physical item, not the literary property or copyright, and therefore assumes no responsibility for violations of such rights or for any other legal issues resulting from the use or publication of the items. It is the responsibility of the researcher to secure permission from the appropriate copyright holder to quote, publish, or reproduce items from Princeton collections, and to acknowledge in print that the materials are used or published “with permission of the Princeton University Library.” Fees for the reproduction or broadcast of any materials from the collections may apply depending on medium, distribution size, intended audience, and holding location. The library requests gratis copies of any publication that includes images from its collections.</li>

							</ul>

							<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

							<ul>
								<li>The Princeton University Library may retain, indefinitely, all data and information regarding patron use of special collections items, including registration, circulation, duplication and publishing requests, as well as related correspondence.  This information may be shared with third parties to address issues of legality, security, the administration of library collections, and other endeavors in support of the mission of Princeton University.</li><br /><br />

								<li><b>I AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS, AND RELEASE PRINCETON UNIVERSTY, ITS TRUSTEES, OFFICERS, ADMINISTRATORS, FACULTY, STAFF, AND OTHER EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITES, DAMAGES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES INCLUDING ATTORNEY’S FEES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCURRED THROUGH THE USE OF THE PRINCETON UNIVERSITY LIBRARY AND ITS MATERIAL.</b></li>
